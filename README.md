# Section 1 - TripTracker App

This section will discuss the TripTracker app project and explain its functionality. See "Section 2" for more details around React.

## Functionality

TripTracker is an app that allows you to read and post reviews for locations all over the world. The home page displays a list of all the destinations that have at least a single review, as well as a search bar to filter for a specific location. You can click into a specific destination by clicking the location name on the home page, which will direct you to that destination's reviews page. These location-specific pages will have all the reviews for that specific location, including options to delete an existing review (will need to add functionality to only allow someone to delete their own reviews) and add a new one.

## Front End

The front end of TripTracker was built using React (see Section 2 for more React-specific details), and the individual Components can be found within the src folder.

## Back End

The back end of TripTracker was built using Sinatra. Github link can be found here - https://github.com/andrew-dewhirst/phase-3-sinatra-react-project. Running `bundle install` will install all the gems and dependencies needed for this app. One additional gem was added to help seed the database - the Faker gem, with additional information available on the Faker gem's [Github](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker).

# Section 2 - Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
